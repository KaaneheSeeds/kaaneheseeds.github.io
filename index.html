    <p>Sugarcane has been growing in Hawaii for centuries. Luckily, this allows you to buy it in big quantities to fit any backyard project you desire.</p>
    <p>Sugarcane grows very fast since it's a grass and handles harsh sun, making it perfect for privacy, wind, and sun blockers. And did I mention it's edible!</p>
